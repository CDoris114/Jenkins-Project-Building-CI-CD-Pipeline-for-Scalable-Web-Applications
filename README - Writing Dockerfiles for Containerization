Flask To-Do List Application

This is a simple web application that implements a to-do list using a standard Flask script. The project serves as a practical example for integration with tools like Jenkins, Git, Docker, and running on Linux, in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments.

Overview

The application provides basic functionality for adding, viewing, and deleting tasks, all managed through a minimalist web server. This project is ideal for testing and demonstrating build automation, testing, and deployment processes using modern technologies.

Purpose and Usage

The main purpose is to serve as a demo project for:
    Automating the application run with Jenkins through pipelines that pull code from a Git repository.
    Containerizing the application using Docker for consistent execution across different environments.
    Testing and running the application on Linux systems using standard scripts and configurations.
    Validating typical CI/CD pipeline stages such as build, test, and deploy.
Features:
    Simple web interface for managing tasks.
    Creating and deleting tasks through HTML forms.
    Temporary in-memory storage for demonstration purposes.
