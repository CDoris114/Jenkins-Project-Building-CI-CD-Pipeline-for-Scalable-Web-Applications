Project Description

This application builds a Docker container image for a Python app and tags it with the current Jenkins build number. The Jenkins pipeline:
    Cleans the workspace before building;
    Builds the Docker image from the source code located at /root/jenkins-project/;
    Tags the image as localhost:5000/my-python-app:<build_number>.
